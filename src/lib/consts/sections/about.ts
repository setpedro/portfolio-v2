            "I'm from Spain's east coast, born in 2007 and raised in a small city. During my childhood I always enjoyed building Legos, then the Nintendo DS sparked some curiosity and amusement, but it wasn't until I received a PlayStation Vita (around age 8) that a piece of software and hardware completely stole my attention. I'd spend hours and hours in Minecraft, exploring and modifying worlds however I wanted. My grandmother once asked what I was doing after two hours of play, and I simply replied \"blocks\" without looking up (according to her, since I don't even remember this myself). That obsession with building shaped everything. I initially thought I'd study architecture or civil engineering, then mechanical engineering, until a great friend who was already programming pulled me into this world over two years ago.",

            'What started with 12-hour YouTube tutorials on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript quickly became an addiction. That natural talent for "building" I had as a kid was finally finding its medium. I\'m now pursuing a Computer Science degree at the University of Groningen (NL), building a deeper foundation while continuing to explore projects that challenge my skills. What keeps me coding is the addictive mental state I hit when programming: that sweet spot where the complexity of the problem perfectly matches my skills and pulls me into a deep flow state I never want to leave.',

            "Outside code, I'm drawn to personal development and spirituality. Not in a cringy way, but as paths to awareness and understanding. I try to stay playful regardless of external chaos, though I can be serious and focused when needed. I'm willing to take risks and make mistakes because failure teaches you what doesn't work, plus usually something extra you didn't expect to learn.",
